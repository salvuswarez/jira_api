HOW TO SETUP APP ENVIRONMENT

Reach out to Cody.hughes@fema.dhs.gov for path to stored python environment package jira_api_env.tar.gz

Requirements for base environment:
    *Must be off the VPN for packages to install, possibly need conda-pack
        conda install -c conda-forge conda-unpack 


1.  Create a folder to place the environment in
        Easiest to create folder in directory of the app IE ./jira_api/app_env

2.  Unzip the tar file for the environment
        in your base environment terminal
            tar -xzf path/to/jira_api_env.tar.gz -C "your/folder/location/here/to/env"

3.  Activate the newly unzipped env
        path/to/folder/for/env/scripts/activate


RUNNING THE TOOL

*Still in testing
Open the jira_data_pull.py file and run it. this file contains all the base dataset pulls.

The iJira.py file is the main interface to the jira python library.

Structure:
Jira_Api/ - main app folder
        app_env/ - folder ready for setup of app environment.
        auth/ - default location for authentication files.
        data/ - Default location for data exports.
        logs/ - Location for log file storage.
        __init__.py - Used for initialization of the Jira_Api folder.
        .gitignore - File containing items or folders to ignore from git.
        conda_requirements.txt - File containing required packages for loading dependencies with conda.
        pip_requirements.txt - File containing required packages for loading dependencies with pip.
        jira_data_pull.py - File containing usage examples for the iJira.py (iJira API).
        iJira.py - The interface / api itself. This is where the core logic is.
