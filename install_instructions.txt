HOW TO SETUP APP ENVIRONMENT

Requirements for base environment:
    *Must be off the VPN for packages to install possibly need conda-pack
        conda install -c conda-forge conda-unpack 
        Reach out to Cody.hughes@fema.dhs.gov for path to stored environment package jira_api_env.tar.gz


1.  Create a folder to place the environment in
        Easiest to create folder in directory of the app IE ./jira_api/jira_api_env

2.  Unzip the tar file for the environment
        in your base environment terminal
            tar -xzf path/to/jira_api_env.tar.gz -C "your/folder/location/here/to/env"

3.  Activate the newly unzipped env
        conda activate path/to/folder/for/env

4.  Unpack environment
        conda-unpack




RUNNING THE TOOL

*Still in testing
open the jira_data_pull.py file and run it. this file contains all the base dataset pulls.

the iJira file is the main interface to the jire python library.
